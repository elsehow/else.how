I live between research and critical technical practice (a la Phil Agre).
Lately, I'm interested in <a href="https://www.dourish.com/publications/2015/NotTheInternet.pdf">this internet's</a> discontents:
DAOs, paranets, meshes, alternative internets.
You can follow that work on
<a href="https://nickmerrill.substack.com/about">my substack</a>.
</p>

<p>
  But I've worked on a variety of topics through my career.
  A high-level list, in roughly reverse-chronological order:
</p>


<ul>

<li>
  <a href="https://cltc.berkeley.edu/internet-atlas/">
    Identifying structural risks to the global Internet
  </a>
</li>

<li>
  <a href="https://medium.com/cltc-bulletin/internet-fragmentation-beyond-free-and-closed-cb8b1dfcd16a">
    Measuring Internet fragmentation
  </a>
</li>

<li>
  <a href="https://cltc.berkeley.edu/mlfailures/">
    Curricula for machine learning bias/fairness</a>
</li>

<li>
  <a href="https://daylight.berkeley.edu/adversary-personas">
    Games for identifying (sociotechnical) security threats
  </a>
</li>

<li>
  <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=L8BCmZAAAAAJ&citation_for_view=L8BCmZAAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC">

  </a>
</li>

<li>
  <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376515">
    Speculative and future-oriented methodology
  </a>
</li>

<li>
  <a href="https://nickmerrill.substack.com/p/why-hasnt-passthoughts-taken-off">Brain-based authentication (or passthoughts)</a>
</li>

<li>
  Cognitive science, particularly spatial memory
</li>

</ul>

<p>
  I'm sure there are throughlines between these projects, but to be honest, I don't look for them.
  I do whatever interests me.
